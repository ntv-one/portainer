# Portainer Templates

Expanded and aggregated list of templates for use in [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/).

## Portainer Tools

If you would like to easily create/maintain your own aggregated templates file, check out @technorabilia's [portainer-tools](https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools). If you use Caprover, I have also created a One-Click App template [ [link](https://github.com/ntv-one/portainer-tools/blob/d91c3c616c369fbaa5eb2e216c1fb22a7b6cbbd4/caprover/one-click-apps/public/v4/apps/portainertools.yml) ] for deploying [portainer-tools](https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools), however it has not been fully tested.

## template.json

This repository contains a combined `template.json` for Portainer, aggregated from these sources: 

- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnburgess/self-hosted-template/master/template.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qballjos/portainer_templates/master/Template/template.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SelfhostedPro/selfhosted_templates/portainer-2.0/Template/template.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technorabilia/portainer-templates/main/lsio/templates/templates-2.0.json
- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mikestraney/portainer-templates/master/templates.json

## Disclaimer

*I created this template file some time ago, it has not been regularly updated, and may contain broken/outdated information and/or links. It's of course free to anyone who cares to use it, but I cannot provide support, and recommend using @technorabilia's [portainer-tools](https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools) to create a fresh list, rather than copying this repo.*

## Thanks

*Many thanks to the maintainers of all of these various lists, and [@technorabilia](https://github.com/technorabilia) for their awesome [portainer-tools](https://github.com/technorabilia/portainer-tools)!*
